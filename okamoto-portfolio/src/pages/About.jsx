            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            As a full-stack web developer with a unique background in aviation mechanics and organic farming, I bring a diverse perspective to solving real-world problems through technology. Iâ€™m passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly applications that make a tangible impact. Outside of work, I enjoy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and board games, which fuel my creativity and strategic thinking. A lifelong learner, I constantly seek to enhance my skills and stay at the forefront of innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments and am excited to bring my varied experience and passions to a team that shares my enthusiasm for continuous improvement and creative problem-solving.
